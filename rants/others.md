# The Others

## Psych Engine

Psych Engine is deader than a doornail, Psych 1.0 is left like a joke without a punchline,
A lot of changes were made in that version, despite that many of said changes were underbaked
or make it much more annoying to work with.

## Codename Engine

THIS RANT WILL BE TOO LARGE TO WRITE IN ONE SITTING, CHECK LATER.

## NightmareVision

It's FrankenTroll, after being denied to use Troll Engine for an FNF mod, the authors glued 
stolen old outdated code together without permission to make an inferior version of it,
because nobody knows better or because the author is heavily boastful about them "making" most of it,
people don't bat an eye to it. Especially due to the authors heavily undercrediting or completely uncrediting 
people who are actually responsible for the code. And also because of them plastering the engine's name everywhere
on the boot logos of FNF mods, Because apparently a mod being on the engine isn't enough advertising.
