# Troll Engine Burgerballs Mod Fork

Hello guys this is me burgerballs, this here is the fork i use for my fnf mods.
As troll engine is already perfect i kinda only needed to change small tiny things to make it easier for me.

As this is my own personal fork, expect bloat, this is meant to be used by nobody aside from me!

I've modified the `install_haxelibs` files, before building you should check them out.

NOTE: Do not treat this as an official release!!! This version of the engine is unendorsed by the original creators. Despite this, this fork will try to stay as synchronized with the original release as I possibly can until breaking changes arise.

# QNA

Some questions might be asked about this fork in particular. So I might answer them here. 

Q: Why not just use base Troll?

A:

Some features which I wish to be in base Troll simply isn't there because it doesn't fit the needs of the project, this fork specifically fits my own needs for my own projects.

Q: What about your V-Slice mods?

A:

Big ones like song mods are currently being ported to this Troll fork right now, consider all the QOL mods obselete and no longer in active development.

V-Slice is not a reliable modding platform.

Q: Why not use Psych, or other forks like "P-Slice", or NightmareVision?

A: 

Psych is dead, I do not want to use Psych Engine 1.0. "P-Slice" is just Psych with the menus swapped and that means nothing to me. 

I will not use NightmareVision as all of it's code is taken from an older and inferior version of what Troll Engine has. (see: Vs. EXE 2.5 Fork)

NightmareVision only garners popularity because of Hit Single and other popular mods programmed by the engine's "authors" and is completely unremarkable on it's own (like a modern "Forever Engine"). I'm tired of non-programmers recommending it, all of it's features are all but outdated Andromeda Engine code taken without permission or tangeble credit patched onto a 3 year old version of Psych Engine. Even if this wasn't the case, I wouldn't use it because I do not support the EXE community and wish to see it wiped off the face of the earth
